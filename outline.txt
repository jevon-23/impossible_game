Impossible game


What makes the impossible game? 

- Places in which you can fall through the floor
- Being able to jump on blocks that may be higher
- Having to jump over blocks
- simple side scroller
- blocks that you cannot hit or else you'll die
- score
- 1 life
- end? no end? 

- Can create variations of patterns, and mix and match, could be intersting to figure out? 

- spacebar jump the only input we take from user
- square stays in a stuck position, meanwhile, map is scrolling creating the illusion of the block moving


- What do we correlate the block with right now?
  - not too sure... but we need to ensure that the floor is not only constanly printing, but also moving

  - need to be able to overwrite the terminal in place with the update?
